# Open Energistics
An minecraft forge mod for minecraft version 1.16.5.

## About
This mod add an adaption of ME interface from applied energistics 2, named OCInterface.
It basically do the same thing as the ME interface but with some slight differences.
It permits more encoded patterns, it can be configured using computers from OpenComputers,
and what's more, when patterns are used, it can broadcast a network packet on the network
(OpenComputers'), if properly configured.

Note that you don't need an adaptor to use this block, it can and probably always should 
be directly connected to both Applied Energistics 2 network and the OpenComputers' network.

This mod depends on Applied Energistics 2 and OpenComputers.
