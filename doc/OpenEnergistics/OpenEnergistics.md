# Introduction

Documentations in this folder describe a software with the same
name as the mod itself, running on OpenComputer computers. It is
designed to achieve exactly what AE2(Applied Energistics)'s crafting mechanics
do, but entirely on OC, highly configurable. It is what this mod is actually for.

## Key Features
### Highly Customizable
We want the whole OpenEnergistics be customizable, users can achieve
their specific and unique goals either by configurations within the 
framework or by easily extending the framework.
+ Customizing Storage Priority(in/out and blacklist/whitelist)
+ Customizing Synthetic Route Calculation
+ Customizing Machine Allocation Logic

### Machine Allocation
We want the crafting process allocating machines from a need-to-use
basis. That is we only occupy a machine when we really need it, and
when we don't need it, it could be use by other crafting process.

### AE2 Integration 
We want OpenEnergistics to integrate AE2, allowing to use AE2 network
as storage, and allowing calling AE2's crafting pattern.
