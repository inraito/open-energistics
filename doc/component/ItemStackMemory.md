# ItemStack Memory
This component is a [storage system](../OpenEnergistics/module/storage/StorageSystem.md).
***
Component with a multi-slot inventory.

It could be used as a cache, or a transfer station for
ItemStacks. It looks like a ME drive, with multiple slots to place storage cells.
Pristine itemStack memory will only have a few itemStack slots, and could be extended
by adding more AE2 storage cells.
